Overview of the Pipelines
=========================

The following pipelines are currently available:

- CarveMe + ModelPolisher based - CMPB
- High-quality template based - HQTB

More information about these differnt types of pipelines can be found below.

.. hint:: 

    Which type of pipeline to use with out data is heavily dependant on your organismen, 
    available information for it and the data you wish to use as input.

CarveMe + ModelPolisher based (CMPB) pipeline

High-quality template based (HQTB) pipeline
-------------------------------------------

The HQTB pipeline curates a new model from an annotated genome based on a high-quality template model 
(plus corresponding annotated genome) and additional database information. 

This pipeline aims to profit from already performed (manual) curation of the already existing model, 
to carry this knowledge into the new model. The closer the template is to the original, the more knowledge 
can potential be carried over. Therefore, this pipeline is useful, if the user already has a model of
a similar organism to the one the new model should be curated for.

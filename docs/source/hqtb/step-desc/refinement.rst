Step 3: Further Refine the Model 
================================

The third step of the pipeline is the refinement of the previously generated draft model
to make the model more complete and strain-specific. In other words, fitting it more closely to the input genome.

The model refinement process is splitted into four parts:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    Extension <refine-parts/extension.rst>
    Clean-up <refine-parts/cleanup.rst>
    Annotation <refine-parts/annot.rst>
    Smoothing <refine-parts/smooth.rst>

Developement Notes
-------------------

The current version of the pipeline has been successfully tested on a *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Klebsiella oxytoca* genomes using
a *Klebsiella sp.* reference database and a *Klebsiella pneumoniae* template model.

.. note::

    The pipeline has yet to be tested on different species and specifically Eukarya, if it works without problem on those as well.

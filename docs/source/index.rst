Welcome to SPECIMEN!
====================

``SPECIMEN`` is a Python package that contains a growing collection of workflows for the 
automated curation of high-quality, ideally strain-specific, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).

These workflows are mainly based on the `refineGEMS <https://github.com/draeger-lab/refinegems>`__ :footcite:p:`bauerle2023genome` toolbox.

Additionally, ``SPECIMEN`` allows the use of most of the functions and 
steps of the different pipelines separatly.

TODO:

- something more about pipelines and so on....

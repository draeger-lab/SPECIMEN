# Configuration file for the SPECIMEN HQTB pipeline

# This is the advaned config file. For a shorter version, 
# download the hqtb-basic configuration file.

# Meaning of the default parameters:
#    The value __USER__ indicates parameters required to be specified by the user
#    The value USER indicates parameters required only in specific cases

# Meta info:

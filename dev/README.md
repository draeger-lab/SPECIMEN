# Developer Zone

This is a directory containing information, notebooks with open work and testing examples and much more for the developers of the SPECIMEN package. It also serves as an additional hub, where developers can share and discuss their code.

Additionally, some helpful code for making developement easier and standardised between developers has been added here as well.

More information about the different files collected here can be found below.

## Help with Coding

- `docstring-format.mustache`<br>
  As the name suggest, this file contains the basic setup for the docstring
  format used for this package. It can be integrated into your IDE (e.g. VSCode) to allow autodoc to use the correct style.
- `TodoTree_params.txt`<br>
  If you use VSCode, you can install the TodoTree extension and add this file to your settings.json. It will highlight all listed keyword can collect them in a seperate tab. This makes it easier to track TODOs, points of DISCUSSIONs and more and allows faster identification of open issues inside the code.
